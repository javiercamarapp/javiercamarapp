👋 Hi, I’m **Javier**

Founder building **AI-native companies for Latin America**.

I focus on creating **high-leverage AI agent platforms** and shipping real products fast — not demos, not research projects.

---

## 🚀 What I’m building

### 🧠 AI Agent Startup (OpenClaw-based)
I’m currently building a **next-generation AI agent company** on top of **OpenClaw**, designed specifically for **LATAM-scale problems**.

The goal:
- Autonomous agents that **replace workflows**, not assistants
- AI systems that **operate**, not just suggest
- LATAM-first infrastructure, data, and use cases

This is my **big bet**.

### 💳 Moni AI
Founder of **Moni AI**, a personal finance app helping users across Latin America:
- Understand their money
- Centralize accounts
- Make better financial decisions with AI

Consumer fintech + AI, built for real users.

## 🧠 How I work

I’m extremely hands-on and operate at the intersection of:
- Engineering
- Product
- Applied AI
- Rapid execution

I believe the next wave of billion-dollar companies will be built by **small teams with extreme leverage**, powered by AI-native tooling.

I ship fast, learn in public, and iterate aggressively.

## ⚡ Vibe coding & AI-native development

I actively use **vibe coding workflows** and modern AI-first tools to move faster than traditional teams:

**Tools I use daily / experiment with:**
- Lovable  
- Replit  
- Cursor  
- Claude Code  
- Antigravity  
- Codex  
- v0  

I treat AI as a **co-founder**, not a feature.

## 🤖 AI platforms & creative tech

I constantly test, integrate, and break cutting-edge AI platforms:

- OpenClaw  
- ElevenLabs  
- Higgsfield  
- Midjourney  
- HeyGen  

If it’s new in AI, agents, or multimodal systems — I’m already playing with it.

## 💻 Programming languages & stack

**Languages**
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Python

**Stack**
- React / Vite
- Cloud-native architectures
- API-first systems
- Supabase, Stripe, modern SaaS tooling
- AI agent frameworks & orchestration layers

I optimize for **speed, scalability, and iteration velocity**.

---

## 🌎 Philosophy

I’m obsessed with:
- Building real products (not theory)
- Applying frontier AI to real-world problems
- LATAM as a massive, underserved market
- Long-term compounding through technology
